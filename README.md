# Don't Starve
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-c-plus-plus.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)


This is a proof of concept text-based game, demonstrating some mechanics. To be completed in the course of 3 days.

## People do. All the time.
Starvation is an unfortunate problem that about 795 million pepole in the world undergo everyday - they don't have enough food to have an active life. 12.9% of our population is undernourished, hungry, and on the road to starvation if they do not get help.

## Purpose
It is a hard concept to grasp - food and wealth not being distributed equally, but it is still a problem that many people face. Hence, the purpose of this game is to educate us on how lucky most of us are (especially if we are viewing this right now), to even have enough food to live and be active. Not only is it to educate us of the unfortunate lives many lead, but it also to educate even lucky people, who have trouble controlling what they eat within a budget.

## Tools
I used CLion for this project, but any IDE or editor should do.

## Playing
Assuming that you have a C++ editor or a command prompt, you can just test it for yourself.

I hope you enjoy this quick P.O.C game, and that it hopefully turns out okay!
